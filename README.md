# Schulte Table

üß†üïπÔ∏èThe IOS game that improves your brain abilities.

A Schulte table is a grid with randomly distributed numbers or letters used for the development of speed reading, peripheral vision, attention, and visual perception.

The Schulte Table was my first IOS application that I've created from scratch without courses, I've frozen this project at the end of the summer, and at the end of April, I've returned to the project and added quite a lot of features (there has been only 5x5 grid).
